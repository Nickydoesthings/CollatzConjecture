This is a pretty simple program.
It calculates the values of a sequence described in the collatz conjecture given a user-generated starting point.
It also provides some information on the calculation such as how many steps the algorithm took to return to 0 and how much time it took.

This is one of the first full programs I ever wrote in Python.
